📊 Bank Loan Performance, Risk & Profitability Analysis
🔍 About the Project

This project analyzes a bank’s loan portfolio to evaluate loan performance, credit risk, and profitability using Power BI.
The dashboard provides a clear view of loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest trends, and loan quality (good vs bad loans).

The primary goal is to help the bank maximize profit while minimizing loan defaults through data-driven insights.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze 38,576 loan records to understand overall portfolio health

Track ₹435.76M funded vs ₹473.07M received to measure repayment efficiency

Identify high-risk segments contributing to charge-offs

Monitor good loan (86.18%) vs bad loan (13.82%) distribution

Support strategic decisions to reduce losses and improve ROI

🧰 Tools & Technologies

🔍 Key Insights

Fully Paid loans (83%) generate the majority of received payments

Bad loans (13.82%) contribute to a significant recovery gap

Borrowers with 10+ years of employment receive higher funding and show better repayment behavior

Debt consolidation loans dominate the funded amount and perform well

Mortgage and home-owned borrowers show lower default risk than renters

Higher interest rates correlate with higher default probability, not guaranteed profit

💡 Business Recommendations

Tighten credit approval for high DTI and low-grade borrowers

Increase funding toward stable employment and home-owning customers

Apply risk-based interest pricing instead of flat high rates

Focus lending on high-performing loan purposes

Implement early warning systems for payment delays and rising DTI

📈 Business Impact

Identified ₹37M+ potential loss exposure from bad loans

Actionable insights to reduce charge-offs by 3–5%

Supports data-driven credit policy optimization
